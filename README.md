On the 26th of March 2020, the United Kingdom announced a lockdown, or ‘stay at home’ which led 
to most citizens staying indoors and working from home. A furlough scheme was also announced, to 
allow employees to be paid despite the loss of revenue for businesses. The overwhelming opinion of 
the consequences of this lockdown was that it would disproportionately affect businesses, and cause 
closures as well as lower likelihood of opening new businesses while increasing the unemployment 
rate (Allas, Canal and Hunt, 2020). To test these hypothesis, three sectors were chosen that were 
strongly affected, namely: Accommodation and food service activities, Real estate activities and 
Wholesale and retail trade: repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles. The assumption being that 
these fields required a lot of in person interaction, which was not possible during the pandemic.
